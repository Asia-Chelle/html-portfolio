 <h2>My Top Movies for 2024!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Auntie Mame</h3>
<p>Well developed old Hollywood movies always put me in a state of peace. I also love unconvential, postive characters. This movie gave me a 2 for 1 special in both of these deprartments.</p>
<h3>Sing</h3>
<p>This is a lighthearted, feel good movie that both kids and adults can enjoy. It is utterly hilarious while being relatable in many aspects. Plus, the musical talent from all of the singers and music producers is basically ear candy for me.</p>
<h3>Rush Hour I and II</h3>
<p>I grew up on the first two movies of this trilogy so I have a childhood preference for these. Though I was still a child when the third movie came out, the first too are more nostalgic for me. Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan are the perfect duo for comedic relief. These are my go to movies when I want to laugh while reminiscing at the same time.</p>
